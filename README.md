# Brain-Tumor-Detection
# CNN Model Project

## Overview
This project involves a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`cnn_model.ipynb`). The model is designed for image classification and is trained using a dataset to achieve high accuracy in predictions.

## Features
- Preprocessing of image data
- Implementation of a CNN architecture
- Training and evaluation of the model
- Visualization of training performance
- Model predictions on test data

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib

## Usage
1. Open `cnn_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Modify the architecture or hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Dataset
The model is trained on an image dataset. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and available in the expected directory.

## Results
- The model achieves **96% accuracy** on the dataset.
- Training and validation loss/accuracy plots are included for analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
- Experimenting with different CNN architectures
- Deployment of the model as an API for real-time predictions
